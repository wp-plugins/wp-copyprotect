== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it WP 2.6.x compatible? =

Of course it is!

= Why Disable content selection is not working ? =

Actually your theme doesn't have `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` in footer, so please edit the footer of your theme and insert that code. The "disable Content selection" will start working.
